The radial grid can be any implementation of the ContinuumArrays.jl interface, but Atoms.jl has only been tested with CompactBases.jl so far.\nEnergyExpressions.jl (documentation) A library for setting up the energy expression of a system built up from a set of configurations. At the moment, the implementation is geared towards atomic systems (in that it uses data structures from AtomicLevels.jl), but it is applicable to other systems as well, such as molecules.\nSCF.jl (documentation) A library for the solution of integro-differential eigenproblems, in a self-consistent manner, as well as using manifold optimization routines from Optim.jl.\nAngularMomentumAlgebra.jl (documentation) A library for the special case of energy expressions in spherical symmetry, but more importantly, also the computation of tensor matrix elements between spin-orbitals.\nHydrogen.jl (documentation) Contains some of the analytically known results for atomic hydrogen, or more generally, a one-electron system in spherical symmetry.\nCoulombIntegrals.jl A library that implements the calculation of the Coulombic repulsion between pairs of electrons, also known as the Slater integrals.","category":"page"}]
